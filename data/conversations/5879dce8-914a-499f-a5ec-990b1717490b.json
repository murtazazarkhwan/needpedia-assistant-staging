This will link it perfectly to the gaming addiction subjects. 🚀\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. **Parent confirmed**: Idea under Problem ID **20**.\n2. **Your Idea Details**:\n   - **Title** (short & catchy, e.g., \"AI-Powered Parental Gaming Monitors\")?\n   - **Description** (rich-text: Use **bold**, *italic*, lists, links! Explain the idea, why it solves the problem, how it works. Keep it detailed but concise.)\n\n**Example Idea**:\n- **Title**: Gamify Recovery: Reward-Based Apps for Kids\n- **Description**:  \n  Introduce **\"QuestBreak\"**—a mobile app that *rewards kids* for **offline achievements** (e.g., reading, sports) with in-game unlocks.  \n  - **How it works**: Tracks gaming time via AI → Suggests balanced \"quests\" → Parents set limits.  \n  - **Impact**: Reduces addiction by 40% (per studies), builds healthy habits.  \n  [Try prototype](https://example.com) | Open-source on GitHub!\n\n**Reply with your title & description** (or tweak the example), and I'll **create it** + share the live link! 😊  \n\nWhat do you think?
